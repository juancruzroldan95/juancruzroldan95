## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Juan Cruz, a Full Stack web developer with experience in Growth Hacking.

One day, I am going to create my own portfolio, but for now, this is my portfolio ðŸ˜…

ðŸ”­ I am doggedly focused on the user, working to make sure as many people as possible experience the core benefit of the product. I focus on using data and experimentation to improve parts of the platform. I often need to "hack" short-term solutions quickly to understand whether an idea is worth a bigger, long-term investment.

ðŸ’» I'm actually working on **DealFlow project**, an end-to-end solution for private market investments.
